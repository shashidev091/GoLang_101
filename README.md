# Go Learning Journey 🐹

Welcome to my Go (Golang) learning repository! This project serves as a structured log of my progress as I dive into Go's syntax, toolchain, and concurrency model.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- [ ] Master basic syntax (Variables, Slices, Maps, Structs)
- [ ] Understand Pointers and Memory Management
- [ ] Learn Interfaces and Composition
- [ ] Implement Concurrency patterns using Goroutines and Channels
- [ ] Build a REST API with the standard library

## 📂 Project Structure
Each directory focuses on a specific concept:

* **`01-hello-world/`**: The classic first step.
* **`02-basics/`**: Variables, types, and loops.
* **`03-pointers/`**: Understanding address-of and dereferencing.
* **`04-structs-interfaces/`**: Go's approach to "object-oriented" programming.
* **`05-concurrency/`**: Experiments with `go` routines and `chan`.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Download and install Go from [go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### How to use this repo
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/shashidev091/GoLang_101.git](https://github.com/shashidev091/GoLang_101.git)
   ```
2. **Navigate to a module:**
   ```bash
   cd day_one
   ```
3. **Run the Code:**
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

## 📚 Useful Resources
- A Tour of Go - Interactive lessons.
- Go by Example - Hands-on code snippets.
- Effective Go - Best practices and idioms.

## 📄 License
This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details.

### Next Step
Since this is a Go project, you'll need a **`go.mod`** file at the root of your folder to manage your modules. Would you like me to explain how to initialize it and what name you should give your module?
